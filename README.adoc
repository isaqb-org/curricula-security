== How to contribute or participate
Create an issue, a merge- or pull-request

== How to build the documents

Prerequisite: You need a Java Runtime(tm) installed.

You build the output documents with gradle.
That will produce both pdf and html output in German (DE) _and_ English (EN), unless you modify the configuration.

In case you want to change that, adjust the following part of `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
task buildDocs {
  group 'Documentation'
  description 'Grouping task for generating all languages in several formats'
  dependsOn "renderDE", "renderEN"
}
----

In the task "renderDE", certain attributes (aka variables) are defined that configure the corresponding output.
