Curricula WEBSEC and EMBEDDEDSEC

The international Software Architecture Qualification Board (link:https://isaqb.org[iSAQB]) defines curricula on several levels for software architects.

The terminology used in the iSAQB curricula can be found as a (freely available) ebook, published on https://leanpub.com/isaqbglossary/read[Leanpub].

== Latest Release {release-version}

The Advanced Level Curricula WEBSEC and EMBEDDEDSEC are currently maintained and published in both English (EN) and German (DE).
Maintainers and volunteer reviewers collaborate on GitHub to improve the curricula.

**Attention:** WEBSEC is currently still deployed from its https://github.com/isaqb-org/curriculum-websec[own repository].
